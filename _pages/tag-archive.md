## Cybersecurity Challenges

### 1. Network Penetration Test
**Problem:** Identify vulnerabilities in a test network  
**Approach:**
- Conducted port scanning with Nmap
- Exploited vulnerable services
- Gained root access through privilege escalation

**Tools Used:** Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite  
**Key Lessons:**
- Importance of service hardening
- Need for regular vulnerability scanning

### 2. Cryptography Challenge
**Problem:** Decrypt encoded messages  
**Approach:**
- Analyzed cipher patterns
- Implemented frequency analysis
- Developed custom Python decryption scripts

**Tools Used:** Python, Cryptool  
**Key Lessons:**
- Understanding encryption weaknesses
- Importance of strong key management

### 3. Forensic Investigation
**Problem:** Recover deleted files from disk image  
**Approach:**
- Carved disk image for file signatures
- Reconstructed file system metadata
- Extracted hidden messages

**Tools Used:** Autopsy, FTK Imager, Hex editors  
**Key Lessons:**
